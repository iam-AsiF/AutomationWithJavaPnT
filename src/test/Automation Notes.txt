Automation Starts from Here:-

2. Browser Closing
Close - it will only close the active tab
Quit - it will close the whole browser
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Full window browser opening:
firefox usually opens window with full screen, while chrome cannot
take full window. So we need to command chrome to take full screen.
it's called 'browser maximize.'
