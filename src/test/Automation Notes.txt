POM - Project Objet Model, is called the heart of a project
We need to add selenium once in a single project
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Automation Starts from Here:-

1. chrome driver launch format
- System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","./driver's path location")
- here, first string is default for chrome and should be written manually,
- and second string indicates the exact location of the driver
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Browser Closing
Close - it will only close the active tab
Quit - it will close the whole browser app
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Full window browser opening:
firefox usually opens window with full screen, while chrome cannot
take full window. So we need to command chrome to take full screen.
it's called 'browser maximize.'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Web Element: Anything present in a website is called web element.
there are 8 ways to find an elements exact position to a webpage. Those
are - ID, Name, Class Name, Tag Name, Link Text, Partial Link Text,
Xpath, and CSS.
Commonly Used - ID, Name, Xpath, and CSS
Link Text - Preferable for menu, sub-menu tab of webpage
CSS - also knows as selector in the html code option
Should maintain order sequence while considering a task.

Method types-
click(); -
clear(); -
submit(); -

                                        Class - 12

It is needed to call every method sequentially else the code will not work.
suppose if I close a browser before launching it that will not make any sense.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if I want to wait for moment before closing the browser we need to use the
function 'thread.sleep()', it takes input as milliseconds.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To show text message of a web element we need to use 'get.Text()' command
To get a website's title we need to use 'get.title()' method
To get a current page's url we need to use 'get.CurrentUrl()' method

To make a line of codes as a comment press - 'ctrl + shift + /
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Random String Generator-
StringBuild - a java class to arrange a bunch of chars into a string
Random - a class to arrange those chars randomly
append - a method to put every single char after one another

for Inheritance we need to use 'entends' command
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Navigation-
we use navigation to check if a given input in a page is still there and matches
with the actual input whenever we go backward and then forward to that page.
to surf webpages back and forth without clicking back and go back
to =go one page from another we use 'driver.navigate().to("url")'
to go =backward from one pager we use 'driver.navigate().back()'
to go =forward from one pager we use 'driver.navigate().forward()'
to =reload a page we use 'driver.navigate().refresh()'
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Auth(Authentication)-
used in highly secured webpage, a popup with asking username and pass to
enter the required page, where no option for inspection to check id, name,
xPath. For that selenium has built a special process.

so, we need to use 'driver.get(StringUrl)' and in the Url field we need to put
username and password in the address field after the protocol such as -
(https://Username:Password@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                        Class - 13

Input field check -
When we put a data in the input field and do want to check whether that field
took actual given data or not, for that we can use get.Text() or, get.Attribute()
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Multiple Window -
- Parent/Child tab
- every tab has a unique ID called GUID(Globally Unique Identifier)
- to get the tab's GUID we use getWindowHandle(); for single Guid and
getWindowHandles(); for multiple window's GUID.
- set<String> - to put multiple strings in a single String list - it is same as array
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alert -
a popup window that works with javaScript, when it pops up the whole window
will become inactive. that's a problem for testing.
Alert type - three types -  normal(ok), confirm(ok, cancel), prompt(input filed,
ok, cancel)
meaning -> ok - True ; cancel - False

example - suppose a website asking for cookie permission, microphone or
camera permission popup.
For better example visit the link -
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/javascript_alerts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dropdown -
If we inspect the dropdown box we will see 'Select' tag name, this will indicate
that line as a dropdown command.
In  selenium there's already a Select class to make it as like as html

There are three ways to select a dropdown value -
i. Select by Value
ii. Select by Index
iii. Select by Visible Text
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Screenshot -
Command
File scrFile = ((TakesScreenshot)searchBar).getScreenshotAs(OutputType.FILE);
FileUtils.copyFile(scrFile,new File("./Screenshots/Google Search Bar.png"), true);
FileUtils.copyFile(scrFile,new File("./Screenshots/File_Name.png"), true);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                        Class - 14

Unit Testing - We use testNG for the Unit Testing

@Test - @ means annotation
Assertion - verify something - an equation 0r, a condition Or, an array comparison.
It is same as if/else formula but in a short line.

TestNG -
test will run according to the naming letter format.
priority list - Upper case, Lower case, Letter

to call a test according to our choice we can use priority method.
step - @Test(priority = 0/1/2.. , description = "");

Before Test - After Test - method - executes only one time
so that we don't have to run everything more than once that is not needed.
for example, browser open, url, close browser.

DependsOnMethod - when one test is dependent on other test. for example,
we want to send a mail. so if we can't login to the mail account we can't send
a mail.
